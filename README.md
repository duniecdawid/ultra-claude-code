# Ultra Claude

A Claude Code plugin that implements a spec-driven development platform. Documentation governs code growth. Agent teams coordinate execution.

## What This Is

Ultra Claude is a portable, reusable Claude Code plugin that turns any project into a structured, specification-driven development environment. You install it, it establishes a documentation layer, and from that point forward — documentation controls how the codebase grows.

It is NOT a framework, library, or runtime. It is a collection of **skills**, **agents**, **commands**, and **hooks** packaged as a Claude Code plugin. When installed in a project, Claude Code gains:

- Three specialized planning modes (Feature, Debugging, Verification) + one execution engine
- Agent teams that coordinate research, implementation, and validation in parallel
- Architectural governance via hooks that enforce architecture conformance
- Documentation-vs-code verification that detects drift
- Plan management with checkpoint/recovery across sessions
- A meta-skill ("Help") that helps extend the system itself

## Core Philosophy

- **Code is a derived artifact.** The specification is the source of truth. Architecture docs exist before code is written, and when code diverges from specs, you fix the spec first.
- **Governance, not bureaucracy.** Documentation acts like zoning laws — you build freely within the constraints, but the constraints control direction. Three enforcement levels: soft (CLAUDE.md), medium (skills), hard (hooks).
- **Not every change needs the same scrutiny.** Additive changes flow freely. Compatible changes get lightweight review. Breaking changes require updating the architecture doc first.

## Quick Start

> **TODO**: Installation and first-use instructions will be added when the plugin implementation begins.
